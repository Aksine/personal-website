## Introduction

Hey there! I'm Arnold, but I go by @Aksine in the online world.I enjoy indepth discussion about various topics regarding technology,philosophy and emotions.

I have always been very fascinated with computers and  have very broad surface level knowledge in this topic, down from transistors to all the way at the top with complex architecture that spans multiple systems. I'm still trying to fill in the gaps in my knowledge tree in this domain and I am looking to specialize in a direction that would really interest me.

In my spare time, I really enjoy doing projects on my homelab (i've got a very expansive one that includes multiples sites which is described in more detail in this blogpost).The personal website is another project that itself is built with  whole CI/CD pipeline and is hosted on a k3s cluster in my Australia homelab (more details in this blogpost).

My other interests include HEMA fencing, video games and running. 

I started HEMA fencing since Mar 2024 and it is very interesting fun and rewarding sport. I specifically do Longsword fencing, it is actually quite close to real sword fighting Initially the cool factor of using a longsword is what drew me in, but later on, i came to appreciate the actual sport. Also turns out that the swordfighting you see in Anime or Movies are not at all true to life!!


For videogames ,these days i mostly play League of Legends these days with few other single player games like CP2077 ,SF6 etc here and there. 

As for running, , i usually run 10ks two to threes times a week and current PB for 10K is 54:27. By no means i am a competitive runner.


## Career

Currently in my IT career,I am currently looking to transition to being an DevOps engineer. I am currently self-learning skills like Automation,CI/CD pipelines, Git ,Kubernetes to get ready and trying to master the basics.

I worked previously as an IT consultant who dealt with technologies regarding Infrastructure,Security and Networking ,mostly involving VMware,Cisco,Microsoft and a bit of Linux.



I am very well versed with AWS and i have dabbled in other cloud providers like Azure,GCP,Oracle Cloud, as lot underlying infrastructure concepts are similar (its only really the pricing models and marketing jargon that you have to figure out).

## Computer related stuff

As i mentioned earlier in the career segment , my interests in computer don't stop there . At the top of mind,these are some of following topics that i want to delve deeper into (they may have some significance  in my career).

- Learn all about BGP and how ISPs work with them
- Build Linux from Scratch
- Learn about graphics programming
- Learn about kernel programming
- Learn about assembly programming
- Learn about processor micro-architecture
